### Hi there! üëã
I am your guy Axel, a Computer Sciences undergraduate at Facultad de Ciencias UNAM, in Mexico City.

### Range of interests 
- Computing Theory
- Computer Graphics
- Audio Signal Processing
- Programming Languages Theory
- .NET Framework, Python and Low-level computing

### Some fun facts
- "Ahexo" has no special meaning, it's just a letters scramble I use as a general username almost everywhere.
  - The correct way to pronounce it in English is …ë-j√¶- ßkz-o ä, something like "ah! checks out".
- I own three dogs: 
  - Dinky (‚ôÇÔ∏è, Maltesse)
  - P√°nfilo (‚ôÇÔ∏è, Schnauzer)
  - Emilia (‚ôÄÔ∏è, a mixed-breed stray dog my family adopted)
- My first computer program (following Hello World, of course) was a Turtle doodle of a square written in Ruby in a Compaq Presario F700 back in 2010.

You can reach me easily via e-mail ([ahexo@ciencias.unam.mx](mailto:ahexo@ciencias.unam.mx)), I'll be glad to read you :)
