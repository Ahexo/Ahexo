### Hi there! 👋
I am your guy Axel, a Computer Sciences undergraduate at Facultad de Ciencias UNAM, in Mexico City.

### Range of interests 
- Computer Graphics
- Audio Signal Processing
- Programming Languages Theory
- Web Development (specially front-end stuff)

### Some fun facts
- I own three dogs: Dinky (♂️, Maltesse), Pánfilo (♂️, Schnauzer) and Emilia (♀️, a stray dog my family adopted).
- "Ahexo" has no special meaning, it's just a letters scramble I use as a general username almost everywere.
- My first computer program was a Turtle doodle written in Ruby in a Compaq Presario F700 back in 2010.

You can reach me easily via e-mail, I'll be glad to read you :)
