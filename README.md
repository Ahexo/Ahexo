### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I am your guy Axel, a Computer Sciences undergraduate at Facultad de Ciencias UNAM, in Mexico City.

### Range of interests 
- Computing Theory
- Natural Language Processing
- Audio Signal Processing
- Formal Languages Theory
- .NET Framework, Python and Low-level computing

### Some fun facts
- "Ahexo" has no special meaning, it's just a letters scramble I use as a general username almost everywhere.
  - The correct way to pronounce it in English is É‘-jÃ¦-Ê§kz-oÊŠ, something like "ah! checks out".
- My first computer program (following Hello World, of course) was a Turtle doodle of a square written in Ruby in a Compaq Presario F700 back in 2010.
